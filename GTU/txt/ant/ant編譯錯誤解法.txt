解法 : 

You need to change the Java Version for ANT also because 
If you are using your Run Time Environment as JDK1.8 then 
Your ANT should be also point to same version or Ant should 
refer tools.jar file from JDK1.8/lib/tools.jar location. 

To fix this issue i your Eclipse Go to Window --> Preference --> Ant -->Runtime -->Global Entries . 
Here check and update tools.jar path with latest version as below.: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_60\lib\tools.jar

Then run your build script issue will be resolved. :)
