 PSA: Monstrum runs perfectly on the Vive using Revive
Game looks and runs awesome on the Vive with Revive.

1. Make sure to install Oculus Home and Revive on your PC.

2. Goto your Revive installation folder. Mine is at C:\Games\Revive

3. Inside the Revive installation folder, open another folder called Revive. For me the path is C:\Games\Revive\Revive

4. Copy everything (including folders) inside C:\Games\Revive\Revive (into your Monstrum directory. For me that's C:\Games\Steam\SteamApps\common\Monstrum

5

Create a shortcut with the following in the target field including quotes.

"C:\Games\Steam\SteamApps\common\Monstrum\ReviveInjector_x64.exe" "C:\Games\Steam\SteamApps\common\Monstrum\Monstrum.exe -oculus"

The path should be whatever your Monstrum path is. This is also where you copied the Revive injector.

6. Make sure your Xbox One controller is on. start Steam VR, and launch the shortcut you made above.

7. Enjoy!
