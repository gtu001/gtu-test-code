Before you go on, Comrade
Simply put for every romance:

    When he/she calls you always accept his/her requests right away
    Be supportive and friendly with his/her
    Don’t accept money from him/her when he/she offers it
    Pick all the “physical” dialogues to get closer to him/her (like kissing him/her)
