Heres a few important things that aren't noted in the text document:
1: Game is in YOUR_GAME_DIRECTORY\Half-Life Alyx\game\bin\win64\hlvr.exe
2: Run the game as admin to avoid losing your save file and not being able to load the next area
3: If the game won't run then close it and start steamvr first
4: To change language and playername go to C:\Users\YOUR_NAME\AppData\Roaming\Goldberg SteamEmu Saves\settings and edit account_name.txt and language.txt (Appdata folder is hidden so just click view and then click show hidden items or press WINDOWS+R and type %appdata% in the box that shows up)
5: If you can't get past press trigger to start, try reinstalling the game as a torrent instead of parts
6: If you want to use cheats, right click on the game's shortcut on your desktop, and at the end add the parameter -console -vconsole. Then run the game as admin (as usual) and once your'e in game press ~ to open the console. Here are some cheats.
